I'm Ingrid, a PhD researcher at the University of Leeds researching Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) and artist control frameworks.
I have an MEng, BSc in Computer Science with High-Performance Graphics and Games engineering from the University of Leeds.
During my undergraduate I was introduced to NPR and I never seemed to stop thinking about it!

Outside of my research, I enjoy teaching, widing participation for women, non-binary and disabled people.
Outside of university, I am an avid indoor climber, crocheter and artist.
