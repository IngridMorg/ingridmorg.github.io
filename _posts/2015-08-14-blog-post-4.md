This May I was lucky enough to attend Expressive and Eurographics in London.
For the latter, I was a student volunteer helping attendees, running mics and problem solving on the spot.

As a first conference experience it was truly wonderful, especially Expressive which is perfectly situated in my field.
At expressive, I presented my first poster on temporal coherence, at which I met some wonderful inspirations in my field and had some wonderful discussions.
