Starting in 2023 as a Master student I was luck enough to be a teaching assistant for the University of Leeds computer graphics module.
I continued my involvement during my PhD where I gained more experience in both teaching and marking.
The labs follow a drop-in format meaning in each session I am presented with a variety of unique problems.
Debugging computer graphics is always a lot of fun, especially when it looks cool, and I find a lot of joy in helping students debug their own work and realise how capable they are.

The module is taught in OpenGL, it covers line drawing, clipping, culling and 3D pipelines including GLSL.
