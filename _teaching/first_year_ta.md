As an undergraduate and during my masters I was given the opportunity to be a teaching assistant in the first year computer science project labs.
In these session, I helped student learn and apply their knowledge in C programming.
Students were performing image compression and decompression, with custom unit tests and high coding standards.
The module was a great mix of practical computer science and bit-level manipulations which was an honour to help with and teach.
